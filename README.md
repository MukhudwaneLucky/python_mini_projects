# Python Mini Projects

### Project Tutorial 1 : Conway's Game of Life Simulation
In this project, i explored Conway’s Game of Life. i learned how to
set up a basic computer simulation based on some rules and how to use
matplotlib to visualize the state of the system as it evolves.
the implementation of Conway’s Game of Life that i followed emphasizes simplicity
over performance. You can speed up the computations in Game of Life in
many different ways, and a tremendous amount of research has been done
on how to do this. You’ll find a lot of this research with a quick Internet
search.
