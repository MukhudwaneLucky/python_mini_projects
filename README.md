### Project Tutorial 1 : conway's game of life simulation
In this project, i explored Conway’s Game of Life. i learned how to
set up a basic computer simulation based on some rules and how to use
matplotlib to visualize the state of the system as it evolves.
the implementation of Conway’s Game of Life that i followed emphasizes simplicity
over performance. You can speed up the computations in Game of Life in
many different ways, and a tremendous amount of research has been done
on how to do this. You’ll find a lot of this research with a quick Internet
search.

### Project Tutorial 1 : conversational framework for building chatbots 
chatbots are increasingly allow people to find information and receive answers 
not only faster than via other means, but also more intuitively.
This project presents a framework for conversational agents centered around
the abstract Dialog object.The Dialog framework allows us to easily create 
conversational components and add them to applications, extending them without
much effort and decoupling them for easy testing.For next steps, we might extend
our chatbot’s ability to be conversational by training an n-gram language model
or a connectionist model on a conversational food corpus.
